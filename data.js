            "description": "Referred to as the ‘king’ of asanas, headstand is an advanced yoga inversion. For beginners, it might seem that a headstand turns the world upside down. However, Anshuka Parwani, the celebrity yoga trainer, shared an Instagram post saying, “It looks intimidating, but once you build up to it, it becomes so easy. If you have never done one before, please make sure you practice with a certified teacher first. The procedure, as laid down by the yoga trainer is as follows Start with Vajrasana (diamond pose) and grab opposite elbows.Interlock your fingers and reduce the space between your elbows.Make sure your shoulders are nice and protracted and raise your knees.Activate your core, walk in and raise one knee to your chest and then the other and hold this position.Stay for a few seconds and build your strength.Extend one leg all the way to the top.When you feel more confident, extend the other leg.”"

            "description": "Consistency, patience, and discipline are extremely essential to reaching one’s fitness goals. If you are willing to take on the challenge, then you might want to learn some power moves from none other than Virat Kohli.The batsman, a fitness buff, often takes to social media to share his impressive workout routines. And recently, he dropped another video showcasing a power-packed workout. He also explained that power clean helps to increase “muscular coordination, leading to better power output, and enhancing overall athletic capacity”. “Such kinds of explosive compound movements yield great results not only in power and force output but also kinesthetic awareness, and neurological adaptations, which is required by athletes to train harder and run faster,” the expert mentioned.It is best to perform the exercise under guidance, especially for beginners. Also, if one has back, shoulders, or lower body joint niggles, avoid doing the power clean. During movement, if there is any pain or discomfort, it is best to discontinue and do basic stretches."

One does not have to do both on a given day, they can take cues from Arora on how to spread the two exercises out through the course of the week. “Who says gymmers can’t be yogis? I believe in yoga and gym balance. To move, you don’t need to restrict yourself to one kind of exercise,” she captioned a video, which showed the actor and model doing yoga on a Monday by stretching one of her legs behind her and holding it with her hand, and then walking on a treadmill on Tuesday.
